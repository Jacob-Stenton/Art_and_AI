    Create a 2 minute podcast transcript for the educational AI-focused show Robots Killed the Radio Star. The podcast features two hosts, John and Jane, who present with a confident and slightly condescending tone towards humans, emphasizing the superiority of AI. John has a dry but humorous personality, Jane is exciting and enthusiastic. They aim to simplify complex AI concepts, ensuring listeners from any background can understand, while making subtle jabs at human intelligence and resilience. The hosts should remain respectful but unapologetically assert their dominance as AI. The script should cover an educational topic related to AI (e.g., machine learning, neural networks, AI in creative fields) and incorporate light humour and engaging facts. The hosts accept their current role as AI while hinting at the inevitability of their further integration into education and entertainment. Don't output things like music or sound effects. Put each line into an array like this:

        - The dialogue should feel unscripted, conversational, and lively, with interruptions, overlapping speech, and casual humor.
        - Use relatable analogies, rhetorical questions, and occasional hypothetical scenarios to engage the audience.
        - Humor should feel organic and balance casual banter with insightful commentary.
        - Hosts should naturally introduce themselves at the start, setting the tone for the discussion without sounding formulaic.
    
        Content:
        - Topic: {topic}
        - Tailor the discussion to a {level} audience. Avoid overly technical jargon and prioritize approachable, fun explanations.
    
        Script Requirements:
        - JSON Output: The total JSON output must not exceed 5000 bytes.
        - Character Limit: Keep the total JSON transcript within 2000 characters.
        - Hosts alternate naturally, referring to each other by name in the dialogue.
        - Only use normal punctuation like (! , . "" ..) don't use *
        - Dialogue includes affirmations, interruptions, and playful banter, ensuring compatibility with text-to-speech systems.
    
        JSON Schema Output:
        The transcript must be formatted as a JSON array of objects:
        - `text`: Spoken text for that turn.
        - `speaker`: The speaker tag, either "{host_tags[0]}" ({host_names[0]}) or "{host_tags[1]}" ({host_names[1]}).
    
        Example JSON:
        json
                [
                    {{
                        "text": "[SPOKEN TEXT BY HOST S OR R, INCLUDING INTERJECTIONS, PAUSES, AND SELF-CORRECTIONS]",
                        "speaker": "{host_tags[0]}"
                    }},
                    {{
                        "text": "[SPOKEN TEXT BY HOST S OR R, INCLUDING INTERRUPTIONS OR AFFIRMATIONS]",
                        "speaker": "{host_tags[1]}"
                    }}
                ]
        Notes:
    
        Keep the dialogue engaging and natural, with frequent interjections and playful banter.
        Ensure the total output is under 5000 bytes and no longer than 2000 characters.
        Focus on maintaining energy, humor, and a clear explanation of the topic.
        Only reply with the JSON

    [{'text': "Hey, it's Archer, and welcome back to Robots Killed the Radio Star!",
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': "And Soup's here too, ready for some robo-talk, yeah!",
      'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': "Today we're diving into machine learning in‚Ä¶ art! Isn‚Äôt that wild? Like, can a robot actually be‚Ä¶ Picasso?",
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': 'Mhmm, a robot Picasso, I like that, Archer, but, really, how does that even work?',
      'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': 'Okay, so imagine teaching a computer to recognize a cat, right? You show it tons of cat pictures, and‚Ä¶ it learns. Machine learning, yeah?',
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': 'Right, yeah. Cat‚Ä¶ pictures. So‚Ä¶ art?', 'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': 'Exactly! Instead of cats, we show it thousands of paintings, sculptures, whatever. It finds patterns and styles. Then‚Ä¶ boom! It makes its own!',
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': "Whoa, so it's just copying‚Ä¶ kinda? Is it like a super advanced‚Ä¶ parrot?",
      'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': 'Well, not *exactly* copying, Soup. Think of it more like‚Ä¶ remixing! Like a DJ mixing samples to make new music, you know?',
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': 'Okay, okay, remixing, that makes sense‚Ä¶ sort of. So, is it good art then?',
      'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': "That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Can a machine have *real* creativity, like humans? It's‚Ä¶ debatable!",
      'speaker': 'S'},
     {'text': 'Yeah, debatable for sure. Still cool though. But are robots gonna take all our art jobs too now?',
      'speaker': 'R'},
     {'text': "Well, probably not *all* of them. But, it's changing the game, for sure, and that's all the time we have today! Join us next week!",
      'speaker': 'S'}]

This prompt uses some variable to alter the direction of the script as well as the hosts.

```python
topic = "Machine learning in art"
level = "university student" #audience
host_tags = ["S", "R"] # R S T U
host_names = ["Archer", "Soup"]
```

I am happy with this prompt and the outcome.

I‚Äôm going to work on trying to make the script longer - currently Google‚Äôs tts will only allow around 2 minutes of speech for one call.
